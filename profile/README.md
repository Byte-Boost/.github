# Hello there ðŸ‘‹
## We are Byte-Boost
We are a team of Systems Analysis and Development students, currently studying at [FATEC Prof. Jessen Vidal](https://fatecsjc-prd.azurewebsites.net/), in SÃ£o josÃ© dos Campos. 
We officially began working as a team on **_March 7th, 2023_**, and have been learning new technologies together ever since.

## What have we done so far?
up until now, we have worked on our first API _(Aprendizagem por Projeto Integrado)_, which you can see [here](https://github.com/Byte-Boost/Plataforma-Scrum).

## Who's in the team?
Since our founding, our team has been through quite a few changes, and it will probably continue to do so in the future as well. You can find our current and past members [here]() (Not working yet).

## What do we work with?
With our goal of studying, learning and working with as many technologies as we can, expanding our horizons and honing our skills, we have ventured into multiple Languages, Programs, Websites and Frameworks. 
some of them include: Python, HTML5, CSS3, Visual Studio Code, Github, Figma, Amazon Web Services, Bootstrap and Flask.
